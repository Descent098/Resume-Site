# Resume-Site
My Old Personal Resume Site, written in flask and deployed to Heroku.

This repo exists only for posterity so that anyone interested in how I made my first attempt at a resume site can take a look.

## Usage

### Install dependencies
You can install all dependencies using pip: ```pip install -r requirements.txt```

### Running the server
You can run the server by running ```python routes.py``` or ```python3 routes.py``` and then access the site by navigating to http://localhost:5000.
